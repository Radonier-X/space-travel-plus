[mod-description]
space-travel-plus=Makes space travel more realistic, making spaceships take longer to travel and more \nSpaceships will break alot, so be careful\n Currently in Alpha, modifications will occur\nCustomizeable to an extent

[mod-setting-name]
distance-factor=Distance scaling factor
brake-drag-enabled=Enable brake drag
platform-max-speed=Space platform max speed (km/s)
acceleration-formula=Limiting acceleration formula
weight-factor=Weight factor in acceleration (inverse logarithmic)
modify-asteroid-definition=Change asteroid definitions
modify-asteroid-health=Change asteroid health
modify-asteroid-health-upto-medium=Change asteroid health only upto medium
asteroid-health-modification-percent=Asteroid health percentage

[mod-setting-description]
distance-factor=How much the original distances are multiplied by \n(eg: factor of 10, original distance = 15000, new distance = 150000)
brake-drag-enabled=A way to slow down the ship by a little \nDoes not affect speed during travel \nActivates only when thrust is zero
platform-max-speed=The maximum speed a platform can achieve \nThe default speed is the speed of light :) \nYou won't reach the default speed anytime soon
acceleration-formula=How does the spaceship acceleration occur when it approaches max speed
weight-factor=How much does weight affect acceleration \nThis factor is inverse logarithmic \n(6 means weight divided by 10^6) \nNote: Weight is given in kg in game (not in tons) 
modify-asteroid-definition=Change asteroid definitions so that asteroids spawn less proportional to distance scaling
modify-asteroid-health=Change asteroid health by a fixed perecentage so that ships can destroy it faster
modify-asteroid-health-upto-medium=Change asteroid health of small and medium asteroids only \nWorks when Change asteroid health setting is enabled
asteroid-health-modification-percent=Percentage of health of new asteroids \n(eg: percentage of 25, original health = 400, new health = 100)

[string-mod-setting]
acceleration-formula-relativistic=Relativistic
acceleration-formula-quadratic=Quadratic
acceleration-formula-linear=Linear 

[string-mod-setting-description]
acceleration-formula-relativistic=Acceleration sharply decreases only when speed is near max speed
acceleration-formula-quadratic=Acceleration decreases quadratically
acceleration-formula-linear=Acceleration decreases linearly
