Hello there! Radonier writing
This is my fisrt mod I made on a whim
I know some lua but I'm not that good at good practices
Some of the code here may seem inefficient and you are right!
I've used AI (specifically Gemini) in figuring out the asteroid spawn definitions (only)
All the other code is fully hand written!
If you use VS Code, collapes the regions for better code readability
I have plans in the future to make it more modular
Also forgive my english, its my second language
